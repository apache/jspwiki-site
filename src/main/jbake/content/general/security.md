## Reporting New Security Problems with Apache JSPWiki

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks against its products.

We strongly encourage folks to **report such problems to the private [security mailing list first][]**, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in our source code will be ignored.

If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use the project's [JIRA issue tracker][].

The private security mailing address is: <security@apache.org>

The process of handling a possible vulnerability is described [here][].

## Asking Questions About Known Security Problems

Questions about:

* if a vulnerability applies to your particular application
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* availability of patches and/or new releases

should be addressed to the users mailing list. Please see the [mailing lists page][] for details of how to subscribe.

## Known Security Vulnerabilities

Known security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache JSPWiki are listed at the [CVE][] page.

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behavior that has security impact, or if the descriptions in one of the pages are incomplete, please report them privately to the Apache Security Team. Thank you.

## Errors and Omissions

Please report any errors or omissions to the [dev mailing list][].
