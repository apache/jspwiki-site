## Welcome to Apache JSPWiki

[Apache JSPWiki][] is a leading open source [WikiWiki][] engine, feature-rich and built around standard [JEE][] components (Java, servlets, JSP). 

Some of its [features](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=JSPWikiFeatures) include:

  * [WikiMarkup](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=TextFormattingRules) / Structured Text
  * File attachments 
  * Templates support
  * Data storage through your choice of two [WikiPage Providers][], with the capability to create and plug in new ones
  * [Security][]: fine grained control over authorization and authentication, yet simple to configure
  * Easy [plugin][] and [page filter][] interfaces
  * UTF-8 support
  * JSP-based
  * Easy-ish [installation][]
  * Page locking to prevent editing conflicts
  * Support for Multiple Wikis
  * [Custom User Preferences][]

You can see who is using [JSPWiki today][], and the [WikiMatrix][] page shows you a comparison with other wiki's.
